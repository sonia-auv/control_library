# Description
This submission contains the files used in this video on [Modeling, Simulation and Control of an Autonomous Underwater vehicle](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/modeling-and-simulation-of-an-autonomous-underwater-vehicle-1586937688878.html). This submission models a 6-DoF autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a position and velocity controller for the AUV. You can switch between low and high fidelity sensor and environment models based on your application needs.

Aerospace Blockset is used to model the dynamics of the vehicle. [Watch this video to learn how to model the thrusters using system identification](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/matlab-and-simulink-robotics-arena-from-data-to-model-1518156121608.html)
